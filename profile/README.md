## About Us

**Manufac Analytics** is a technology firm that provides digitization & automation solutions to manufacturers to help them become operationally efficient. ⚡

If you are looking for an open source project to contribute to, consider looking into:

- [manufac/inchi](https://github.com/manufac-analytics/inchi)
- [manufac/perry](https://github.com/manufac-analytics/perry)

Both these repositories try to integrate chemistry, chemical engineering and software development to create useful utilities for process engineers. The development isn't quite active on these repsitories but feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute and we can try to open up our core team's schedule to faciliate PR reviews, code briefing, etc.
